- **API**: GitHub REST API v3

## Important Notes

### Public Repositories Only
GitGotchi tracks commits from **public repositories only**. Private repository activity will not be reflected in your plant's health. This is a limitation of using GitHub's public API without authentication.

### Rate Limiting
The GitHub API has rate limits for unauthenticated requests:
- **60 requests per hour** per IP address
- If you hit the rate limit, you'll see an error message and need to wait before refreshing
- For higher rate limits, consider implementing GitHub OAuth authentication

### Privacy
- No authentication required - just enter your GitHub username
- Only public data is accessed
- No personal information is stored on our servers
- Username is saved locally in your browser for convenience
